# Caesar

Simple Python Reverse Shell Prototype For Educational Purposes.

This reverse shell can be used to build an in-depth profile of a target by extracting sensitive data and analysing that data. 

The server script was developed in Ubuntu\
Install Elasticsearch and set up an index before running server program.

Data Used in this example has been generated for this demonstration and it is not a real person's data nor does it represent a real individual's browsing activitiy. 

This should be used as a guide for anyone loooking to get into malware development and wants a general overview on how to extract and analyse data. This prototype does not cover antivirus evasion techniques.

User input handling can be improved however, all the features should work just fine if configured properly. 

Do not be stupid and use this on an unauthorised system!!! 
I assume no responsibility for your actions. 



Tools used during development:\
• Elasticsearch\
• Python\
•	VirtualBox\
•	Ubuntu ISO\
•	Sublime Text Editor\
•	Windows\
•	PyCharm\
•	DB Browser for SQLite\
•	files.000webhost.com (FTP Server)
